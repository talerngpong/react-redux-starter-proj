Welcome to React-Redux-Starter-Proj
==================

This is the simplest Todo web application excluding any beauty of CSS. Currently, this is a SPA (Single-Page Application) website based on React, a library for building user interfaces, and Redux, a state container library. 


Purpose
-----------

The purpose of this project is to wrap anything that I should know before make my first website with React. For using Redux, It came after I found that passing any values from a child React component to its parent one or from a child component to other components was a huge nightmare.
